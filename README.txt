for making a button:
if (GUI.Button(new Rect(rect scale here), "button name"))
{
   button function goes here
}
for making a toggle:
make a bool such as
private static bool weeee;
then do
weeee = GUI.Toggle(new Rect(rect scale here), weeee, "toggle name"))
if (weeee)
{
 toggle function goes here
}

recommended rect scales are in the gui template class
